# Write a 24GB file in chunks of 8MB. Basic test of write I/O
# bandwidth. For this kind of test it is important that the file is
# substantially larger than the main memory of the machine. If the
# file is 2GB and main memory is 1GB then up to 50% of the file could
# be cached by the operating system and the reported write bandwidth
# would be much higher than what the disk+filesystem could actually
# provide.

# Writing 500 files of 1 MB, spread out in 10 directories

# Write 50 128MB files (6.4GB) with a block size of 64kB, then
# read random files among these 5000 times. A good way to test
# random access and mask buffer cache effects (provided the sum
# size of all the files is much larger than main memory).

# Read and write 1 file of 1 GB. Is it cached in mem?
