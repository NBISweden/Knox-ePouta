\section{Complete SOB results}
\label{appendix:SOB}

We report, in the tables below, the writing times for each test from
Section~\ref{experiments:NFS}, on each VM of the chosen set.
%
The first row of each table specifies, in order, which nodes were used
in the tests.
%
For test~\ref{experiments:SOB:test:big} and
\ref{experiments:SOB:test:cache}, the second line represents the
reading time. In parenthesis, we indicate the bandwidth (rounded to
the closest first decimal).%

\section{Pitfalls and Caveats with Neutron Linux Bridges}
\label{appendix:secgroups}

Work under progress...

Let us describe in greater details how the security rules are
implemented. This is relevant to understand pitfalls in connecting the
VMs from different clouds together.

If we display the \texttt{FORWARD} chain, we see the openstack add a
``relay'' chain, named \texttt{neutron-linuxbri-FORWARD}.

\codeblock{iptables-forward.sh}

All rules are now in that relay chain. If the traffic, whether inwards
or outwards, goes through the VM interface, via the tap interfaces, it
is redirected to the security group chain.

\codeblock{iptables-forward-neutron.sh}

The security group chain gathered all incoming and outgoing traffic
from the VMs. Surprisingly, that chain now forks and redirects the
traffic to an \emph{incoming} or another \emph{outgoing} chain. If
those latter chains do not filter the traffic, the packets are then
accepted.

\codeblock{iptables-sg-chain.sh}

Let us now inspect the outgoing chain onto a particular VM (Note the
name starting with \emph{neutron-linuxbri-\textbf{o}}). It starts by
allowing traffic from the DHCP client (by returning to the previous
chain, wich accepts the traffic).

\codeblock{iptables-neutron-sg-input.sh}

Otherwise, it jumps to a \emph{source chain} (which name starts with \emph{neutron-linuxbri-\textbf{s}}).

\codeblock{iptables-neutron-sg-source.sh}

The source chain filters out traffic that is not the proper pair of IP
and MAC address related to that VM. This is important since a VM
cannot then simply add a network or an interface and connect through
it. In the hypothetical scenario where that VM creates a bridge, the
MAC address of the bridge might flicker between the ones from the
added interfaces. Moreover, in another scenario where the VM network
is augmented with another local network, say \ip{192.168.0.0/24}, the
traffic would be filtered by the source chain. This is relevant in
case we want to implement on openstack installation inside VMs (such
as Mosler, or the so-called \emph{Triple-O}, Openstack on Openstack).

Back to the outgoing chain, after checking the allowed IP/MAC pair
(which can be updated through some neutron commands), it checks for
established connections, or drops them if they are invalid. In other
cases, the filtering continues onto a \emph{fallback chain} which
simply drops that traffic.

\codeblock{iptables-neutron-sg-output.sh}

Finally, we observe that the openstack security rules, which we added
in neutron, end up in the \emph{incoming chain} (which name starts
with \emph{neutron-linuxbri-\textbf{i}}). The DHCP traffic is allowed,
along with \texttt{ping} and tcp traffic (on all ports), from the IP
range \ip{10.101.0.0/16}. Some specific neutron commands can allow
other network ranges, and this is where the rules would appear.

\codeblock{iptables-neutron-sg-input-2.sh}

In case the above ping and tcp rules were absent, the traffic is then
accepted if it comes from another VM on the network. This is
implemented with IPset.

\codeblock{iptables-neutron-ipset.sh}

Notice here that the set contains the IP of the machines that were
booted on Knox, and not ePouta. We would have to update the IPset, or
update the plugin itself to automatically include the other VMs across
borders. It was not necessary since we had the `All tcp ports' rule
already in place.
