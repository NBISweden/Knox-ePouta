Summary...
\vspace{1cm}

\paragraph{Future Work.}
%
It is probably possible to tweak the NFS settings, or the TCP settings
in the kernel, to gain even further speed.
%
It would be interesting to scale up the solution to
\textbf{many-many-many} nodes in ePouta and some nodes in Knox, to see
%how much the link can be shared.
at which point the communication link gets saturated.
%
Finally, it is worth updating the Slurm and NFS solution with other
tools, to improve disk access, such as (i)~the use object storage or
(ii)~the use a separate disk volume attached to the storage VM, rather
than an ephemeral disk on file (\ie the default in \texttt{libvirt}).
